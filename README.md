# Neural_Networks_With_Scikit-Learn

This repository contains how deep learning can be implemented using scikit learn. It covers perceptrons and multilayer perceptrons.

Perceptrons are just neurons with step activation while multilayer perceptrons are effectively feed forward system. 

One of the dataset used for multilayer perceptron is the diet dataset and it can be found in <a href=http://kaggle.com/chrisbow/2018-calorie-exercise-and-weight-changes target='_blank'>here</a>

This dataset correspondngs tothe recording made by an individual on a particular day. The weight is expressed in stone, pounds and ounces. The dietry deatils for each day is also provided, like calories intake and the typeof exercise done. It also has the last column as the weight gain or loss.

The Restricted Boltzman Machine is also used in this repository for dimensionality reduction

The data used for the dimensinality reduction is the mnist dataset and it can be gotten from <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv target='_blank'>here</a>
